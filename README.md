This exercise uses the Python package **pyam**, an open-source community toolbox for
analysis & visualization of scenario data.
The package was developed to facilitate working with timeseries scenario data
conforming to the format developed by the
[Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC)](https://www.iamconsortium.org).
The package is used in ongoing assessments by the IPCC and in many model comparison
projects at the global and national level, including several Horizon 2020 projects.
